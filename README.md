## üåü Projects

Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

1. **OLA Ride Bookings** - This dashboard helps the OLA Rides Bookings to understand their customers better and revenue. It helps the OLA know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know the booking status by ride, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on factors responsible for these cancel issue. OLA can understand payment methods, vehicle types and ratings.

3. **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis using SQL and PostgreSQL** - This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset.
